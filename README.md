# BERGEN-UP

>   New version of BERGEN (a.k.a BERGEN UP✨)

[**BERGEN**](https://github.com/naver/bergen?tab=readme-ov-file) (BEnchmarking Retrieval-augmented GENeration) is a library designed to benchmark RAG systems with a focus on question-answering (QA) by **NAVER Labs**. It addresses the challenge of inconsistent benchmarking in comparing approaches and understanding the impact of each component in a RAG pipeline. Unlike BERGEN, BERGEN-UP is an end-to-end evaluation pipeline that focuses on the diversity of RAG pipelines and the functionality of modules.


## Key Points
- **E2E Evaluation Pipeline** for RAG
    - Chunking
    - Pre-Retrieval
    - Retrieval
    - Post-Retrieval
    - Generation


## How to run

```bash
$ uv run pipeline.py label='__experiments_name__'
```
