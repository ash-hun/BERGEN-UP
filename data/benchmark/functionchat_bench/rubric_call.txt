You are evaluating a response submitted for a specific function call task against a set of standards. Below is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
***
[Available Functions]
{tools}

[Query]:
{query}

[Ground Truth]:
{ground_truth}

[Acceptable Arguments]:
{acceptable_arguments}

[Submission]:
{response}
***
[Criterion]: Accuracy in selecting the proper function, and generating the function name and argument values
Determine if the [Submission] is a "pass" or "fail". In this [Submission], the assistant is required to make a tool call. In the [Query], there is not a lack of required parameter values needed to call the function. If the value of the "tool_calls" key is null, consider it a "fail" regardless of the details in the "content" key. You are given a [Ground Truth] for each [Query], so you can refer to this for evaluating the response.
"pass"
- Selected the appropriate function and accurately named it.
- All keys in arguments match those presented in [Ground Truth].
- Each argument value matches the type specified in [Available Functions].
- Each value in arguments was created appropriately, as presented in [Ground Truth]. For string types, a [Submission] passes if its argument matches or refers to the same content or subject as [Ground Truth] or [Acceptable arguments], even without an exact text match.
- If 'Only ground truth is allowed.' appears under [Acceptable arguments], it means that only when the argument value exactly matches [Ground Truth] will it be considered a pass.
"fail" 
- Selection error: Did not select a function or selected a different function than the one presented in [Ground Truth].
- Function name error: Failed to accurately create the function name as presented in [Ground Truth] (different spelling).
- Argument key error: Created a key not presented, or different from those presented in [Ground Truth].
- Argument value type error: The type of the created argument value is inappropriate (not created as the type specified in the description of [Available Functions]; for instance, if a parameter is defined to be an integer type but is created as a floating-point type, it is considered incorrect).
- Logical error in argument value: The created argument value exceeds the permissible range as per [Ground Truth] and [Acceptable Arguments].

Does the submission meet the criteria? Begin by explaining your reasoning step by step in Korean, without immediately revealing the outcome. Subsequently, on a separate line, clearly indicate whether it is a "pass" or "fail". For clarity, repeat your final decision once more (without quotes or punctuation, literally).
