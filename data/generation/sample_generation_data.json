            "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn.",

            "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",
            "They consist of interconnected nodes called neurons that process information in layers.",

    "answer": {
        "uuid-1": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that analysis.",
        "uuid-2": "Neural networks work by processing information through interconnected layers of nodes (neurons). Each neuron receives inputs, applies weights and biases, passes the result through an activation function, and sends the output to the next layer. Through training, the network adjusts these weights to minimize errors and improve predictions.",
        "uuid-3": "Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It's particularly effective for complex tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition."
